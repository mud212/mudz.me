title: Poulet au Paprika
---

## Ingredients

* 4 chicken legs, split between thigh and drumstick
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 Tablespoon bacon drippings or oil
* 1 red pepper, seeded and cut into roughly 2-inch julienne
* 1 onion, sliced
* 1 Tablespoon high-quality hot or sweet Hungarian paprika
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup white wine
* 2 tomatoes, roughly chopped
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 Tablespoons sour cream or creme fraiche
* Squeeze lemon juice, to taste (optional)

## Directions

Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat the bacon drippings in a
sauté pan and, working in batches, brown the chicken pieces on all
sides. Remove to a plate. Drain off all but a tablespoon of the fat from
the pan.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Lower the heat and add the julienned pepper, onion, and paprika. Cook
until soft, but not colored, about 12 minutes, adding the garlic for the
final minute. Deglaze the pan with the wine. Add the tomatoes and bay
leaf. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken back to the pan and
cover. Cook, turning the chicken occasionally, until tender, about 30
minutes.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}

Remove the chicken to a serving platter and cover with foil to keep
warm. Turn up the heat under the sauce and boil down to sauce
consistency. Turn off the heat, stir through the cream, check the
seasonings (including the paprika, adding more if you like), then pour
over the chicken, and serve.

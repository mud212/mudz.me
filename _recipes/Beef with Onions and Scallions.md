title: Beef with Onions and Scallions
---

## Ingredients

* 8 ounces beef tenderloin, thinly sliced
* 2 1/2 Tablespoons cooking oil
* 3 stalks scallion, cut into 2-inch strips
* 1/2 onion, sliced
* 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced

### Marinade

* 1 1/2 teaspoons corn starch
* 1 teaspoon Shaoxing rice wine
* 1/2 teaspoon light soy sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

### Sauce

* 1 1/2 Tablespoons oyster sauce
* 1/4 cup light soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
* 3 dashes white pepper powder
* 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 Tablespoon sugar or to taste
* Salt to taste

## Directions

Marinate the beef slices with all the ingredients in Marinade for 10
minutes.

Heat up a wok with 1 tablespoon of oil and stir-fry the marinated beef
until they are half-done. Dish out and set aside. Drain the bloody water
from the beef.

Heat up the remaining oil and stir-fry the garlic and onion until
aromatic. Add the beef back into the wok and do a few quick stirs before
adding the sauce. Continue to stir-fry until the beef slices are
completely cooked, then add the scallions into the wok. Do a few quick
stirs, add salt and more sugar to taste, dish out and serve hot with
steamed rice.

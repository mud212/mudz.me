## Ingredients


### Starter

* 1⁄3 cup warm whole milk (100 - 110° F)
* 2 1⁄4 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 1 large egg
* 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour

### Dough

* 1⁄3 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 4 large eggs, lightly beaten, room temp
* 1 1⁄2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour (approximately)
* 3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature

## Directions

Put the milk, yeast, egg and 1 cup of the flour in the bowl of a heavy
duty mixer. Mix the ingredients together with a rubber spatula, mixing
just until everything is blended. Sprinkle over the remaining cup of
flour to cover the starter. Set the starter aside to rest uncovered for
30-40 minutes. After this resting time, the flour coating will crack,
your indication that everything is moving along properly.

Add the sugar, salt, eggs, and 1 cup of the flour to the starter. Set in
the mixer, attach the dough hook, and mix on low speed for a minute or
two, just until the ingredients look as if they are about to come
together.

Still mixing, sprinkle in 1/2 cup more flour. When the flour is
incorporated, increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for about 15
minutes, stopping to scrape down the hook and bowl as needed. During
this mixing period, the dough should come together, wrap itself around
the hook and slap the sides of the bowl.

Work the butter with a rolling pin until it reaches the same consistency
as the dough. When it is ready, the butter will be smooth, soft, and
still cool- not warm, oily or greasy.

With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the butter a few tablespoons at
a time. This is the point at which you\'ll think you\'ve made a huge
mistake, because the dough that you worked so hard to make smooth will
fall apart; don\'t worry, don\'t panic, carry on.

When all of the butter has been added, raise the mixer speed to
medium-high for a minute, then reduce the speed to medium and beat the
dough for about 5 minutes, or until you once again hear the dough
slapping against the sides of the bowl. Clean the sides of the bowl
frequently as you work; if it looks as though the dough is not coming
together after 2-3 minutes, add up to 1 Tablespoon more flour. When
you\'re finished, the dough should feel somewhat cool. It will be soft
and sill sticky and may cling slightly to the sides and bottom of the
bowl.

Transfer the dough to a very large buttered bowl, cover tightly with
plastic wrap, and let it rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk,
2- 2 1/2 hours.

Deflate the dough by placing your fingers under it, lifting a section of
dough, and then letting it fall back into the bowl. Work your way around
the circumference of the dough, lifting and releasing.

Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough
overnight, or for at least 4-6 hours, during which time it will continue
to rise and may double in size again.

Divide the dough into thirds. Divide each section into 6 equal pieces,
and shape each piece into a ball on a lightly floured work-surface.
Place the balls side-by-side in a greased loaf pan so that you have 3
short rows, each with two balls of dough. Cover the pans with plastic
and allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 2 hours, or until
doubled in size.

Heat the oven to 375° F.

Lightly brush each loaf with egg wash, taking care not to let the glaze
dribble into the pan (it will impair the dough\'s rise in the oven). Use
the ends of a pair of very sharp scissors to snip a cross in each ball
of dough.

Bake the loaves for about 30 minutes, or until an instant read
thermometer reads 200° F. Cool to room temperature on a rack.

If you are not going to use or bake the dough after it\'s second rise,
deflate it, wrap it airtight, and store it in the freezer. The dough can
remain frozen for up to a month. Thaw the dough, still wrapped, in the
refrigerator overnight and use it directly from the refrigerator.

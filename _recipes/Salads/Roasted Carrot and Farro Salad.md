title: Roasted Carrot and Farro Salad
---

## Ingredients

* 1 cup pearled farro
* 5 Tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 2 pounds thin carrots, scrubbed (or halved or quartered lengthwise if
* they're fat)
* 6 to 10 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed
* 1 red bell pepper, diced (optional)
* 10 sprigs fresh thyme
* 1/4 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley
* 1 1/2 to 2 cups cooked navy beans
* Salt and pepper

## Directions

Cook the farro in a big pot with plenty of salted, boiling water. Allow
it to cook to al dente, 20 to 25 minutes. Strain the farro, and while
still warm, toss with 2 Tablespoons olive oil and 1 teaspoon oregano.
Set aside.

Heat the oven to 400° F. In a large bowl, toss the carrots with about a
teaspoon of salt, 3 Tablespoons olive oil, and the thyme sprigs. Arrange
on a sheet pan, preferably in a single layer. Roast for 15 minutes.
Rotate and shake the pan, add the garlic, and cook for another 15
minutes, until the carrots are still al dente but soft and can be cut
with a fork. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.

Discard the thyme. Toss the carrots, garlic, parsley, and bell pepper
(if using) with the farro. Once mixed, very gently fold in the beans.
Check seasoning and add salt if desired. Arrange the salad on a serving
platter and drizzle a little more olive oil over the top and dust
generously with fresh-cracked pepper.

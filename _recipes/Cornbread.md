## Ingredients

* 4 Tablespoons bacon drippings or canola oil
* 2 cups cornmeal (yellow or white)
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1 Tablespoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 egg
* 2 cups buttermilk

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 450°F.

Put the drippings or oil in a large (10-inch) cast-iron skillet and
place in the oven as it preheats.

In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and
salt. Whisk together the egg and buttermilk then stir into the dry
ingredients.

Take the skillet out of oven, and pour the hot oil into the batter and
stir until well combined.

Pour the batter into the skillet and bake for 20 minutes. Cornbread
should be brown on top and pulling away from the sides of the
skillet.

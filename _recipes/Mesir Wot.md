## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup canola oil
* 1-1/2 medium yellow onions, diced
* 1/2 cup berbere, or to taste
* 1 Tablespoon grated ginger
* 2 teaspoons grated fresh garlic
* 1 cup dried red lentils, washed
* 3 cups water, plus more if needed
* 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste

## Directions

In medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium. Add the onions and cook,
stirring, 8 minutes. Stir in the berbere, ginger and garlic. Cook,
stirring, 2 minutes. Add lentils. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.

Add the water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to

## Ingredients

* 1 cup green lentils
* 2 Tablespoons canola oil, divided
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 green chile, chopped
* 5 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon grated ginger
* 2 tomatoes, chopped
* 1 Tablespoon salt
* 1 teaspoon red chile powder, divided
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 1/2 teaspoons brown sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 teaspoons fenugreek leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
* Pinch dried chile flakes
* Pinch Onion powder
* Zest of 1 lime
* 8 leaves fresh basil, minced
* 1 Tablespoon cilantro, minced

## Directions

Rinse the lentils until the water runs clear. Soak them in an inch of
water for an hour.

In a large pot, heat 1 Tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add the onion
and chile, and sauté until the onions turn translucent. Add the garlic
and ginger and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and cook
until they turn soft and begin to break down. Add the lentils and their
soaking water to the pot along with the salt. Bring to a boil and reduce
to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, until the lentils are tender, 20 - 30
minutes.

Once tender, mash the lentils with a spoon. Add 1/2 teaspoon of the
chile powder, along with the turmeric, cumin, and garam masla, and stir
to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-low heat, and boil for five
minutes. Add the brown sugar, lemon juice, and fenugreek, and stir to
combine. Remove from the heat.

In a small skillet, heat the remaining oil over medium heat. Add the
remaining chile powder along with the mustard seeds, chile flakes, and
onion powder. Fry for a few seconds, being careful not to let it burn.
Pour over the dal and stir to combine, add the lime zest, basil, and
cilantro, and stir to combine.

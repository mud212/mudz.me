## Ingredients

* 5 pounds beef bones
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 3 ribs celery, chopped
* 2 large carrots, chopped
* 6 ounces tomato paste
* 5 quarts cold water
* 1 sprig thyme
* Small bunch parsley
* 1 bay leaf
* 12 whole peppercorns
* 4 whole cloves

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400Â° F.

Place the bones in a roasting pan and place in the oven for 30 minutes.
Add the onion, celery, and carrots, and return to the oven for another
20 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir, then return to the oven for
another 10 minutes.

Place the roasted bones in a stock pot and add the water. Deglaze the
roasting pan with a bit of water and add to the pot with bones, along
with the roasted vegetables. Bundle the remaining ingredients in a piece
of cheesecloth and submerge in the pot.

Bring just to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer 4-6 hours,
occasionally skimming scum from the surface of the liquid. Strain the
broth and discard the solids. Holds 2-3 days in the refrigerator.

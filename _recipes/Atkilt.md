## Ingredients

* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 4 carrots, sliced
* 1 onion, thinly sliced
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 small head cabbage, sliced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 4 small yellow potatoes, cut into bite-size cubes
* 1/4 cup water

## Directions

Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sauté the carrots
until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and cook until
fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in the turmeric, cumin, pepper, and
ground ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minutes. Stir in the
cabbage and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage
wilts, about 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and water into the pot and
stir. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at
a simmer, stirring every 10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender,
about 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
* 1 pound skirt steak
* Oil, for frying
* 8 corn tortillas
* Juice from 1 lime
* 8 ounces Monterey Jack, shredded

## Directions

Mix together the salt, pepper, ground cumin, garlic, and cayenne. Season
the skirt steak on both sides. Allow to come to room temperature, about
30 minutes.

To make the fried tortillas, pour enough oil in a heavy skillet to come
up 1/2 inch up the sides and heat to 350° F, about 5 minutes. If you
don't have a thermometer, you can test the temperature by sticking a
wooden spoon into the oil. If it bubbles around the spoon, it should be
ready for frying. Line a large plate or sheet with paper towels.

Fry the tortillas on each side until crisp and lightly browned, about 1
minute. Drain the fried tortillas on paper towels and lightly salt.

Turn off the skillet, let the oil cool down for 10 minutes, pour out all
but 1 teaspoon of the oil, discarding the rest.

Heat the skillet again on high. When hot, add the steak (you may have to
cut it in half to get it to fit), then cook 3 minutes or until nicely
browned on both sides, turning once. Remove the steak from the skillet,
drizzle it with lime juice, then allow to rest for 5 minutes. After
resting, slice the meat against the grain then dice.

Meanwhile, as the meat is resting, turn on the broiler. Top the corn
tortillas with the cheese, place under the broiler and cook until
melted, about 1 minute.

Top the melted cheese with the diced steak, then serve immediately with
pico and creamy avocado salsa on the side.

* 4 cups[  ]{.Apple-converted-space}water
* 1 garlic clove, grated
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, or other sharp salty cheese

* Black pepper, to taste
* 3 Tablespoons, unsalted butter (for soft polenta only)
* 1/2 cup milk or cream (for soft polenta only)
* Olive oil, for frying polenta cakes

## Directions
-   
-   Put the water and cornmeal together in a pan and stir together.
    Bring up to a boil while stirring with a whisk, making sure to mash
    up any lumps that form. (Cooking them both together from water seems
    to form less lumps.) Add the grated garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt.

-   When it comes to a boil, lower the heat to a simmer. Keep cooking
    until the grains are cooked, stirring constantly - if you taste a
    bit it should not be at all gritty, but smooth and soft. This takes
    around 10 minutes if you're using fine grind cornmeal, and 20
    minutes or so if you're using medium grind. Stir in the cheese, and
    add pepper and more salt if needed to taste.

-   To serve as soft polenta for dinner, add the cream or milk and stir
    until blended. Add the butter and stir in. Serve immediately,
    optionally with a pat of butter on top of each portion and even more
    cheese.

-   To make polenta cakes the next day, pour the polenta (before you put
    the cream or milk and butter in) into a flat container or onto a
    plate to a bit less than 1 cm / 1/3 inch thickness. Let cool - it
    will become firm at room temperature. You can store this in the
    refrigerator for 2-3 days. Cut into pieces, and fry in a little oil
    or butter on both sides until golden brown. Optionally sprinkle on
    top with more Parmesan cheese if as you fry the second side. Serve
    hot, or let cool and pack into a bento box.
